Objective:
As the Chief Data Scientist for the cityâ€™s school district with 15 schools (charter and district), the task is to analyze student math and reading scores along with school information. The goal is to provide insights for strategic decisions on future school budgets and priorities.

Key Findings:

District vs. Charter Performance:

Charter schools outperform district schools by about 40% in both math and reading.
Charter schools spend less per student while maintaining higher overall passing scores.
Budget Comparison:

Top-performing schools (charter) spend approximately $40 less per student compared to bottom-performing schools.
Subject Scores:

Average reading scores are higher than math scores in the district.
Further analysis by grade (9th, 10th, 11th, 12th) shows consistent averages with 80% in math and 82% in reading.
Implications:

Charter schools demonstrate higher academic performance with more cost-effective budgets.
Prioritizing budget allocations for charter schools could lead to improved overall student performance.
A focus on enhancing math scores across all grades could improve the district's academic standing.
Recommendations:

Consider allocating resources efficiently, especially favoring charter schools with a track record of better performance.
Investigate strategies to improve math scores across all high school grades.
This summary captures the major observations and recommendations based on the data analysis conducted for the PyCitySchools scenario.
